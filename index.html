                <p>Potted cacti are a popular choice for indoor and outdoor plants due to their unique appearance and
                    low
                    maintenance requirements.<br> <br>Cacti generally grow slowly and don’t need frequent repotting.
                    When
                    they do outgrow their pots, choose one that's only slightly larger than the current pot. <br>
                    <br>Ensure
                    the pot has drainage holes to avoid root rot, which can be a concern if the roots sit in stagnant
                    water.

                <p>Potted plants are a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor spaces because they add beauty,
                    freshness,
                    and a touch of nature to any environment. <br><br> Pots come in different materials, such as
                    ceramic,
                    plastic, terracotta, and metal. Each material has its pros and cons. For example, terracotta is
                    porous
                    and allows for better airflow, but it dries out faster, while plastic pots retain moisture.
                    <br><br>Potted plants are an easy and effective way to add life to your home, balcony, or office,
                    and
                    with the right care, they can thrive and enhance your space for years!
